The Station Exchange Format (SEF)
=================================

.. warning::

   This format is still under active development. Incompatible changes are likely.

This is a file format specification and Python API for newly-digitised historical weather observations. It has been produced to suport the work of the `Copernicus Data Rescue Service <http://ensembles-eu.metoffice.com/C3S-DR/index_C3SDR.html>`_ in particular to allow people rescuing observations to present them for widespread use in a simple but standard format.

This format is for land observations from fixed stations. Marine observations, and moving observing platforms, should use the `IMMA <https://icoads.noaa.gov/e-doc/imma/>`_ format instead.
